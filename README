MCP2200 driver API open Source implementation.

I was tired of booting windows to play with my MCP2200 breakout, I decided to develop this library to manipulate it on UNIX.
The original Microchip API is somehow sloppy, but is documented (see http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/devices.aspx?dDocName=en546923 datasheet and DLL examples). This library is conform to the original API but add more methods.

Some functions were missing, like setting manufacturer string. These are available in this implementation thanks to "noe" reverse-engineering found on stackoverflow (http://stackoverflow.com/a/23106926).

Finally, the mcp2200_config command line tool to configure the chip is included as an example of the library.
